I built this project as a personal challenge to use nothing but HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript, as well as to serve as a sample for my students in the [Nextech Catapult] (https://nextech.org/students/catapult/) program. I wanted to build out a fully functional website using just the tools they were learning, and it has served as a great reference when teaching them coding.
